# MelbDjango Assignment One

That's right, this year we're asking you to complete an assignment â€“ starting completely from scratch!


### MelbDjango Guestbook

We're going all the way back to 1998 and adding a guestbook to our site! We'd like users to be able to submit their
name and a comment that's immediately published on the site in chronological order. Optionally users should be able to
include an email address so that we can contact them (double check that this is a valid email, please).

In the backend we'd like to be able to see when the entry was created as well as have the ability to hide the entry
without having to delete it.

It would be nice if the frontend showed you how long ago the post was created and said "thank you" if the user has just
created a new post. At the bottom of the page it should show how many people have left us messages.

I wonder if it would be possible to implement some sort of SPAM filtering? This would be optional, but it would be nice
to block posts with words like "Lose weight", "100% free" and the age old "Dear friend".

Don't forget that we'll need tests for any of the important functionality included!

Doesn't seem too hard, right? Hopefully we could have it all done by Monday August 17th.
